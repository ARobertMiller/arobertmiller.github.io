            <p>Gretchen Kathleen Elizabeth Ravensblood is a wizard. Well, a wizard in training. Okay, she's an
                apprentice, if
                one really wants to split hairs. She's been apprenticed to her Uncle Bartholomew for the last 30 years,
                and the
                cantankerous old curmudgeon is adamantly opposed to the use of magic in helping people resolve their
                problems.</p>

            <p>But one day Gretchen is approached by a young girl seeking help to recover her lost cat, Princess.
                Gretchen
                agrees, and thus embarks on a very low-stakes magical adventure to rescue Princess. But even with the
                help of
                Gretchen's fairy companion Bumblebee, a gnomish inventor turned exterminator named Oliver Fizzlecrank,
                and the
                grudging assistance of her uncle, will they be able to save Princess?</p>

            <p>Kick back by the fire, grab a hot cocoa, and find out what happens in this whimsical, slice of life, cozy
                fantasy adventure.</p>

            <p>Wizard NOT For Hire is my first novel, and I'll be posting the rough on <a
                    href="https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/78106/wizard-not-for-hire-cozy-fantasy">Royal Road</a> as I
                write
                it.</p>

            <p>New chapters posted each Sunday night at 6pm (GMT-6).</p>
