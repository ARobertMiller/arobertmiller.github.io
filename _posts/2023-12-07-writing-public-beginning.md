I've always wanted to be a writer. Maybe that's something that you can relate to. I've always wanted to be writer, but was always too afraid. Afraid of rejection. Afraid of mean feedback. Afraid of not being able to provide for my family. Pretty common fears, probably.

But after a lot of reflection, I'm pushing past those fears. Right now is the best time in my life to really give this a shot. I have a unique, priviledged position that gives me the freedom to approach writing as a career, from the very start.

Now, I know what you're thinking. That flies in the face of pretty much all writing advice. No one tells a novice writer, "Go for it. Quit your day job, start writing, and one day you'll make it big." The statistics don't lie: most writers never make it big. Most writers write like shit when they're first starting.

But I'm going for it anyway.

And I'm doing so with a plan, from day one.

The first step in that plan is to write in public. I've created an account on Royal Road, where I'll be serializing my novel chapter by chapter. Why? There's a few reasons.

## I have no audience or connections

I am not Travis Baldree. I can't just sit in a dark room, pump out my first novel, post about it on Twitter, get a bunch of shares from pro authors, and then get 2,600+ pre-orders. I actively scrubbed my social media accounts years ago, and am starting from scratch in that regard. I **need** a way to start connecting with readers. ASAP.

## The publishing industry is changing incredibly fast

What worked a century ago no longer works now. Hell, what worked a decade ago or even five years ago no longer works now.

Serialization is gaining steam in the US (it's already rather massive in Asia), and it provides authors with new revenue streams and new chances for exposure. Patreon allows authors to deliver content to their readers for a far smaller cut than any other platform. The Pro membership takes 8% of all income, plus a variable fee per transaction:


| Transaction Size | Processing Fee |
| --- | --- |
| $3 or less | 5% + $0.10 |
| > $3 | 2.9% + $0.30 |

Let's say that an author has 1,000 Patrons with an average sub rate of $5/mo (in truth, many of the most successful RR authors typically have a $10/mo sub rate).

That's $5,000 gross.
- ($400) platform fee
- ($245) processing fees

Gives a net of $4,355, or 87.1%. (caveat that there might be foreign transaction fees, or slightly higher payment proccessing fees if the reader uses something other than paypal or venmo)  Either way, that's still a far greater slice of the pie than if the same author sold 1,000 books at $5 a pop on Amazon.

And that doesn't even *preclude* Amazon. Tons of successful serialized authors use the serialization platform as a springboard before eventually moving to Amazon and Ingram.

So all this is to say: the traditional publishing model is rapidly changing, and in ways that can greatly benefit authors. As an aspiring author, I'm trying to take advantage of those changes from day one.

## Integrated, direct feedback

Another cool thing about serialization is the intimacy with readers. Platforms like Royal Road allow for *actual* Choose Your Own Adventure novels: you can integrate surveys after posting a chapter and ask readers what they want to see next. Authors on RR can bring their audience onto platforms like Discord (or even Patreon) that allow for more one-on-one connections than an Amazon review page.

So what's that mean for me? It means I can get feedback on my writing directly from my readers. Not from some stuffy critique circle filled with writers who've never even heard of my sub-genre.

## The End

I'm going for it. Wish me luck.
