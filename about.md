A. Robert Miller has lived many lives. He's been a computer programmer, a data analyst, an NSA cryptologic linguist, and even worked at a corn maze. Now he's living the life of a fantasy author, and loving every second of it. He resides in Illinois with his wife, two cats, and one very spoiled dog.
